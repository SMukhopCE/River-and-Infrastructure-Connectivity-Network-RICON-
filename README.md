# River and Infrastructure Connectivity Network (RICON)
River and Infrastructure Connectivity Network (RICON) â€“ shows the dependency between streamgages and reservoirs as a concise edge list for the Colorado River Basin (CRB). The RICON dataset provides (1) a complete list of edges for the unidirectional network connecting streamgages, reservoirs and NHDPlusflowline features for CRB and (2) attributes of all nodes (reservoirs and streamgages) including their geospatial locations, unique identifiers, immediate upstream and downstream nodes, etc. The RICON data archive available at figshare contains the dataset tables in comma-separated values (CSV) format. Input files are 'sites_df.csv', 'nid_df.csv' and 'NHD_data.RData'. Output file is 'Edge_List.csv' For the latest version of the data please see https://figshare.com/articles/River_and_Infrastructure_Connectivity_Network_RICON_/11849157
